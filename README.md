# Project Proposal

## Inspiration

Sports are a vast source of complex data and statistics and something I find myself watching quite often, which led to the passion behind this project. Due to the high scoring and unpredictability of the NBA, I have devised an idea to analyze this further to gain a better and deeper understanding of not only the sport but the statistics that make it. 

## Data Collection and Models

Data collection for the project will be from various sports websites but mainly that of NBA.com (the official league website) for the official stats of the players and teams. I will be using a classifier approach for the machine learning model. My aim is to use a random forest classification model there are a multitude of reasons however one that caught my eye was that it features feature ranking as well as it utilizes a bunch of decisions trees to try and cover every case.

## Computer Vision (CV)

For the computer vision aspect of this project I will be doing an overlay during games to display the players name, age, (potentially a picture of them if possible) accompanied by all their stats. This can be achieved using bounding boxes and jersey numbers to link the player to the team sheet. I can also look at the colours of the jerseys to determine the team and maybe look at the overall dominance (floor spacing, etc.). 

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Moreover, the natural language processing aspect will entail that of a live chat bot. This live chat bot allows you to ask it a prediction, lets say can Howard score 20+ point tonight? Given the player's history against the team. their recent performance as well as historically and their live performance it can make an educated decision as to what will occur. I am also looking to use this chat bot to allow users to manually switch to view a player of their choosing to and to display all their stats. 

## Reinforcement Learning

Honestly, as of right now I am not quite sure how this part of the project can be implemented in this scope however, I am more than open to suggestions and will try to incorporate this into said project as more information is apparent. Any feedback for this portion would be greatly appreciated.
