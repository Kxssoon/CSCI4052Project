## Reinforcement Learning
### The Intent/Thought Process

- Environment could be the game itself (things like the player position, ball posession, score and the time remaining)
- Then actions like passing, shooting and blocking just to name a few can be included
- The reward would be given based upon the correct prediction
- The agent would take the game as an input and output a probability distribution of the possible actions.

### The Results

Unforunately I was unable to implement this within my project. It was a difficult concept and task to wrap my head around, especially in this context. However through extensive studying and research this past week, I feel like I have gained a better grasp and understanding. To my knowledge this portion was considered Bonus and so I will not be completing it. Thank you.
