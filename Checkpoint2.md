# Checkpoint 2

## Data Collection and Models

Data collection for the project will be from various sports websites but mainly that of NBA.com (the official league website) for the official stats of the players and teams. I will be using the nba_api in order to collect data and  I will be utilizing a classifier approach for the machine learning model. I ended up choosing to use a multilayer perceptron as my model. This was the eventually selected approach due to the importance of feature selection and how it handles non-linear relationships within the data. As mentioned in my proposal feature selection plays a very large role, however the ability to handle complex, nonlinear is key here as that helps with variables such as player performance, team dynamics and historical data/statistics. It was also selected due to it being easy to implement and to get preliminary results to see if the data is useful.

Within this Checkpoint contains a Multilayer Perceptron Classification approach to detect a winning team's probability. The model was run with data from the 2022-2023 season and for the Golden State Warriors team. A label encoder was used to set Wins = 1 and Losses = 0. It was able to predict the winning team with an accuracy of 0.71. (for this please refer to file nbaapiproject.ipynb) This is a general baseline model that I got up and running and will adapt it to work for home and away teams for future matchups in order to detect the likely winner of said game. The NBA preseason just started with the regular season starting around the end of October / early November. With that my hopes of data collection (especially for live data {hence why I had to use data from a previous season for this model}) will grow. This is just a proof of concept to prove that the approach is viable in order to obtain the desired result of what was outlined in the project. Which is predicting which NBA team will win a given game.
